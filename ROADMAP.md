# Foodsaving Tool Roadmap

Only major features and improvements will be listed here.

## [Current development](https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-frontend/milestone/7)

- Setup separate deployment branch for the frontend repository
- Modify pickup dates/series
- Public map of all groups
- Show historic pickup dates
- search-options for storeList / memberList / joinGroup

## [Current discussion (higher priority)](https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-frontend/milestone/9)
