## Current discussion (higher priority)

We want to work on this in mid-term future. We need to think about it more before we can implement it, so active discussion is highly welcome. Feel free to join in!

## Ideas / Brainstorming

Rough ideas, have been mentioned by someone.

- Public landing page for groups (improvement of groupInfo page)

- Make stores groupable in custom categories, offer different colored map markers per category and history filter options
- Sharing of things: text+image with a tag system
- Trustworthiness rating for users
- Undo functionality for changes
- Work teams for groups (foodsaving platform)
- Quiz
- Make karrot into a multisharing platform
