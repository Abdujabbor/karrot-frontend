# A vision for Karrot


## Turning waste into shared abundance

We have experienced the senseless production of waste in our economic system and how it is not sustainable. We have been living off the “waste” ourselves. We have experienced the material abundance of the affluent societies we live in. We have saved stuff that has been or was about to be thrown away, and we have shared these things among friends, family and also complete strangers. Things like food, clothes, bikes, furniture, electronics, etc. We have saved and shared resources not only as individuals, but most importantly collectively, as part of a group, organization or network. We know that we need to find ways of reducing production and consumption of material goods, instead of finding more “sustainable” ways of producing and consuming even more stuff. We know that endless economic growth is antithetical to life on earth and we know that we urgently need to turn this abundance of waste into a tool for less consumption, more community-building and for promoting a culture of sharing and cooperation. And we need to bring this to the masses of the wasteful rich countries, not just the middle-class alternative young people.
That is why we are developing a digital tool for communities to save resources and share the abundance, and we are doing this together with existing movements on the ground, initiatives that are spread around the globe, actually practicing what this tool is meant to facilitate. What we want with this tool is to create the conditions for scalability of these initiatives, that is, to enable the growth and cooperation of self-organizing groups that save resources from waste and share them freely.

## Why a platform?

It is relatively easy for smaller groups to share resources and organize in a gift economy, but it becomes increasingly harder for people to dedicate their time and energy to keep the cohesion in larger groups and to avoid the disintegration of collective action. Having the right digital tools is an important and necessary component, although not sufficient, to increase the significance of the gift economy in relation to markets, and to reclaim the original idea of a sharing and gifting economy. Some attempts in scaling this gift economy have been made in the past and have been relatively successful in what they sought to accomplish. Foodsharing.de in Germany for saving and sharing food, Couchsurfing (despite not being strictly non-commercial any longer) and Trustroots for sharing a place to sleep internationally, and Skjutsgruppen in Sweden for sharing rides are some examples. Karrot has started by serving many groups that are saving and sharing food around the globe, and will become the tool for local movements to organize and grow in their saving and sharing of different resources.
But we are not technology evangelists and therefore very aware that we cannot code into reality things like community, good governance, relations of trust, equality and so on. We can only help materialize these values through the platform where they are practiced by people working on the ground, to facilitate the saving and sharing of resources in a non-hierarchical, participative and democratic way. Development should continue to happen in tandem with these practices and the communities using Karrot, which is why the following roadmap is proposed.


## A rough roadmap

This is not a detailed and definitive roadmap, but an idea of how to take steps towards the proposed vision. It can be roughly divided in two phases, related to user adoption.

**The first phase** is about consolidating a user base that is part of two or more groups. Development should focus on a useful platform for them to coordinate with their groups/teams and to create synergies of cooperation between groups and people in those groups. An example of that, which is already happening in Gothenburg, is the foodsaving group (Solikyl) and the Bike Kitchen group. There is potential for much more in this city, which could prototype this kind of use case.

**The second phase** is about finding other locations to iterate the first phase and also about making Karrot more accessible to a wider public, which would not necessarily join any of the existing groups. The main appeal of Karrot for a wider public would be to have access to sharing features and communicating directly to established groups, which would become hubs for saving and sharing. The possibility to create new groups for sharing stuff or coordinating activities would also be a much more straightforward feature.

Here are the points more or less in order (higher priority first):

- Implement a [general purpose theme](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/1509) and invite new groups to test it. Check the Bike Kitchen theme for reference.
- Facilitate navigation between groups and switching them. For example, a drop-down menu on the group logo at the header to the left, showing other groups that a person belongs to, would probably make a difference. Perhaps there should be a dashboard for people participating in more than one group, instead of the world map, with a feed with the latest and notifications from all the groups.
- [Enable public places](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/354). Besides the usefulness already identified for foodsaving groups, this could be a generally useful feature for communication between groups.
- [Sharing feature]((https://community.foodsaving.world/t/sharing-feature/281)) (per groups at first, and later between groups and public sharing)


## Organisation, PR and recruiting

Karrot is a free and open-source software and its vision should inspire more people to contribute and co-create it. Therefore we need to work also on the following:

- On governance and organisation: finish writing the constitution and defining what kind of association should be created. This would give clear guidelines for the role of contributors and ensures a more transparent and democratic development process.
- [Discuss and define the need and role of funding](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/funding-concept-for-karrot/136). Apply for grants when time is right and there is an opportunity.
- Start doing some PR and recruiting: by improving the website with a clearer description of what Karrot does and its vision, reach out in our networks to show it off and recruit new contributors.
